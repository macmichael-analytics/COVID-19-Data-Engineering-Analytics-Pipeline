# COVID-19-Data Engineering Analytics Pipeline

## End-to-End Azure Solution — Ingestion → Transformation → Analytics → ML → Reporting

## 📌 Project Overview
COVID-19 created a global need for accurate, near–real-time reporting of cases, mortality numbers, vaccination trends, and population-normalized metrics. Many organizations struggled with fragmented data sources, inconsistent reporting formats, and lacked the ability to generate timely dashboards for public health stakeholders.

This project builds a real-world enterprise-grade analytics pipeline  using Microsoft Azure to ingest, transform, store, model, and visualize global COVID-19 statistics.

## ❗ Business Problem
Public health agencies and analysts require a single source of truth to answer key questions:

- How fast are cases rising across countries/regions?

- Which countries have the highest death rates relative to population?

- What are the weekly/monthly pandemic trends?

- How can machine learning help detect future surges?

- However, the challenges include:

- Multiple external data sources (API, CSV, public datasets).

- Data updated daily requiring automated ingestion.

- Complex transformations (date alignment, aggregation, normalization).

- Need for scalable analytics + centralized data store.

- Need for dashboards accessible by leadership in real-time.
