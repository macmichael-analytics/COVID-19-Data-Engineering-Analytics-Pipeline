# COVID-19-Data Engineering Analytics Pipeline

## End-to-End Azure Solution — Ingestion → Transformation → Analytics → ML → Reporting

## 📌 Project Overview
COVID-19 created a global need for accurate, near–real-time reporting of cases, mortality numbers, vaccination trends, and population-normalized metrics. Many organizations struggled with fragmented data sources, inconsistent reporting formats, and lacked the ability to generate timely dashboards for public health stakeholders.

This project builds a real-world enterprise-grade analytics pipeline  using Microsoft Azure to ingest, transform, store, model, and visualize global COVID-19 statistics.
